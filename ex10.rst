Exercise 10: Update Basics
==========================

In the previous exercises we learned how to insert document into MongoDB and what a write concern is. We also learned why ``.save()`` is not a good way of saving your documents and how bulk inserts work. Having covered the basics we will spend this exercise looking at how to use the ``update`` array operators to manipulate document level arrays.

$push Operator
