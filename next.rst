Next Steps
==========

You're not a programmer quite yet. I like to think of this book as
giving you your "programming brown belt". You know enough to start
another book on programming and handle it just fine. This book should
have given you the mental tools and attitude you need to go through most
Ruby books and actually learn something. It might even make it easy.

    **Rob says:** For fun, I recommend you check out Why's (Poignant)
    Guide to Ruby: http://mislav.uniqpath.com/poignant-guide Most of the
    actual programming content will be review by now, but Why is a
    brilliant mind and his book is a work of art. Check out some of his
    open source projects, which are still floating around. You can learn
    a lot by reading his code.

You could probably start hacking away at some programs right now, and if
you have that itch, go ahead. Just understand anything you write will
probably suck. That's alright though, I suck at every programming
language I first start using. Nobody writes pure perfect gold when
they're a beginner, and anyone who tells you they did is a huge liar.

Finally, remember that this is something you have to do at least a
couple hours a night for a while before you can get good. If it helps,
while you're struggling to learn Ruby every night, I'm hard at work
learning to play guitar. I work at it about 2 or 4 hours a day and still
practice scales.

Everyone is a beginner at something.
