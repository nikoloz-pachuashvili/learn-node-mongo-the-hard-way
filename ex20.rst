Exercise 20: Functions And Files
================================

Remember your checklist for functions, then do this exercise paying
close attention to how functions and files can work together to make
useful stuff.

.. literalinclude:: ex/ex20.rb
    :language: ruby
    :linenos:

Pay close attention to how we pass in the current line number each time
we run ``print_a_line``.

What You Should See
-------------------

.. code-block:: console

    $ ruby ex20.rb test.txt
    First let's print the whole file:

    To all the people out there.
    I say I don't like my hair.
    I need to shave it off.

    Now let's rewind, kind of like a tape.
    Let's print three lines:
    1 To all the people out there.
    2 I say I don't like my hair.
    3 I need to shave it off.

Extra Credit
------------

1. Go through and write English comments for each line to understand
   what's going on.
2. Each time ``print_a_line`` is run you are passing in a variable
   ``current_line``. Write out what ``current_line`` is equal to on each
   function call, and trace how it becomes ``line_count`` in
   ``print_a_line``.
3. Find each place a function is used, and go check its def to make sure
   that you are giving it the right arguments.
4. Research online what the ``seek`` function for file does. Look at the
   ``rdoc`` documentation using the ``ri`` command and see if you can
   figure it out from there.
5. Research the shorthand notation ``+=`` and rewrite the script to use
   that.
