<h1>Advice From An Old Programmer<a class="headerlink" href="#advice-from-an-old-programmer" title="Permalink to this headline">Â¶</a></h1>
<p>You've finished this book and have decided to continue with programming.
Maybe it will be a career for you, or maybe it will be a hobby. You'll
need some advice to make sure you continue on the right path, and get
the most enjoyment out of your newly chosen activity.</p>
<p>I've been programming for a very long time. So long that it's incredibly
boring to me. At the time that I wrote this book, I knew about 20
programming languages and could learn new ones in about a day to a week
depending on how weird they were. Eventually though this just became
boring and couldn't hold my interest anymore. This doesn't mean I think
programming <em>is</em> boring, or that <em>you</em> will think it's boring, only that
I find it uninteresting at this point in my journey.</p>
<p>What I discovered after this journey of learning is that it's not the
languages that matter but what you do with them. Actually, I always knew
that, but I'd get distracted by the languages and forget it
periodically. Now I never forget it, and neither should you.</p>
<p>Which programming language you learn and use doesn't matter. Do <em>not</em>
get sucked into the religion surrounding programming languages as that
will only blind you to their true purpose of being your tool for doing
interesting things.</p>
<p>Programming as an intellectual activity is the <em>only</em> art form that
allows you to create interactive art. You can create projects that other
people can play with, and you can talk to them indirectly. No other art
form is quite this interactive. Movies flow to the audience in one
direction. Paintings do not move. Code goes both ways.</p>
<p>Programming as a profession is only moderately interesting. It can be a
good job, but you could make about the same money and be happier running
a fast food joint. You're much better off using code as your secret
weapon in another profession.</p>
<p>People who can code in the world of technology companies are a dime a
dozen and get no respect. People who can code in biology, medicine,
government, sociology, physics, history, and mathematics are respected
and can do amazing things to advance those disciplines.</p>
<p>Of course, all of this advice is pointless. If you liked learning to
write software with this book, you should try to use it to improve your
life any way you can. Go out and explore this weird wonderful new
intellectual pursuit that barely anyone in the last 50 years has been
able to explore. Might as well enjoy it while you can.</p>
<p>Finally, I'll say that learning to create software changes you and makes
you different. Not better or worse, just different. You may find that
people treat you harshly because you can create software, maybe using
words like &quot;nerd&quot;. Maybe you'll find that because you can dissect their
logic that they hate arguing with you. You may even find that simply
knowing how a computer works makes you annoying and weird to them.</p>
<p>To this I have just one piece of advice: they can go to hell. The world
needs more weird people who know how things work and who love to figure
it all out. When they treat you like this, just remember that this is
<em>your</em> journey, not theirs. Being different is not a crime, and people
who tell you it is are just jealous that you've picked up a skill they
never in their wildest dreams could acquire.</p>
<p>You can code. They cannot. That is pretty damn cool.</p>
