Exercise 12: Libraries
======================

Take a look at this code:

.. literalinclude:: ex/ex12.rb
    :language: ruby
    :linenos:

On line 1 we have what's called a "require". This is how you add
features to your script from the Ruby feature set or other sources
(e.g., Ruby Gems, stuff you wrote yourself). Rather than give you all
the features at once, Ruby asks you to say what you plan to use. This
keeps your programs small, but it also acts as documentation for other
programmers who read your code later.

Hold Up! Features Have Another Name
-----------------------------------

I call them "features" here (these little things you require to make
your Ruby program do more) but nobody else calls them features. I just
used that name because I needed to trick you into learning what they are
without jargon. Before you can continue, you need to learn their real
name: ``libraries``.

From now on we will be calling these "features" that we require
``libraries``. I'll say things like, "You want to require the
``open-uri`` library." They are also called "modules" by other
programmers, but let's just stick with ``libraries``.

Extra Credit
------------

1. Research the difference between ``require`` and ``include``. How are
   they different?
2. Can you ``require`` a script that doesn't contain a ``library``
   specifically?
3. Figure out which directories on your system Ruby will look in to find
   the libraries you require.
