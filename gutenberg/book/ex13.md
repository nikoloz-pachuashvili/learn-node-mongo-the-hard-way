Exercise 13: Removing Documents
===============================

We've learned how to insert and update documents. But what if we want to remove documents from the database. Thankfully the **collection** has a method called **remove** that does exactly that. Let's see how it works.

```js{"file":"/code/ex13/ex1.js","indent":4}
```

The result will be

```console
    connected to database
    added document
    removed documents
    documents
    [ { _id: 3, user: 2, read: false } ]
```

Notice that it removed all the documents that matched **{user:1}**. The default behavior of **remove** is to remove all the documents that match. But what if we only want to remove a single document. Luckily there is an option called **single** that allows us to do this. Let's see how it works.

```js{"file":"/code/ex13/ex2.js","indent":4}
```

The result will be

```console
    connected to database
    added document
    removed documents
    documents
    [ { _id: 2, user: 1, read: false },
      { _id: 3, user: 2, read: false } ]
```

That's all there is to removing document in **MongoDB**. In the next couple of exercises we will start digging into how to query and use the data in **MongoDB** using the **findOne**, **find** and **stream** functions.

        One thing you might wonder is how to remove all of the documents in a <strong>collection</strong>. This is can be done in two ways. <strong>remove({}, function(err, result) {})</strong> or <strong>remove(function(err, result) {})</strong>.
