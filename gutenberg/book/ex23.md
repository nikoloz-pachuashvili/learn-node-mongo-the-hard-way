Aggregation
===========

The MongoDB aggregation framework allows the manipulation and transformation of documents in a fast an efficient matter. It allows a lot of operations that previously was only possible to do with the map reduce framework to be done in a fast native manner in MongoDB without involving the use of the javascript virtual machine and it's cost of execution.

It's main limitation is that the aggregation framework can only operate on a single collection at a time. But for things like grouping and summing of documents in a given collection it's the right tool for the job. It was introduced in MongoDB 2.2 and has been adding features for every release of MongoDB since.

One thing to be aware of is that until MongoDB 2.6 one of the main limitations of the aggregation framework was that it could not output to another collections like the map reduce could. In MongoDB 2.6 this changed as the server introduced the ability to output to a non sharded collection using the $out option. But more about that later.
