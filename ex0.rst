Exercise 0: The Setup
=====================

The first thing we need to do is to setup your computer with the correct
tools to allow you to Node.js and MongoDB. Try to follow the instructions
to the letter.

The book assumes we are using the latest Node.js. Let's get started installing.
It also assumes you have experience in ``javascript`` as it will only focus
on ``Node.js`` and ``MongoDB``.

3.  Put the ``TextWrangler`` text editor in your doc for easy access.
4.  Locate your ``Terminal`` application (Under ``Applications`` and then ``Utilities``)

Notes
-----
This might be a hard exerices depending on your level of experience but learning these
fundamental steps is essential to be able to do programming and if not mastered will
make it difficult to make much progress.

Programmers might tell you to use other more advanced tools or editors. I suggest you
stick to simpler tools for the duration of these exercises as these tools will get in
the way of the essential lessons of this book.
